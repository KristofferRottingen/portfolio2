                <h4>Semester Project 2</h4>
                <p>This project is a e-commerce website connected to strapi. th website is currently not completely working for the reason
                that the strapi is a local server and is not currently running. With the starpi running th e website is supposed to have
                a admin side where the admin could add, edit and delete products. The design part of this website is not the best
                beacuse the focus was mainly on the technical part of the project and not the design.</p>
